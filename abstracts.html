              <p>
                Scarlett Ting Jin, The Chinese University of Hong Kong
              </p>
              <h5>Abstract</h5>
              <p>This study compares the equality and equity of four shared micromobility models, including station-based bikesharing, hybrid e-bike sharing, hybrid e-scooter sharing, and dockless e-scooter sharing, with a case study in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Equality assessment is made using Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients, which reveals that hybrid and dockless models are relatively more equal than the station-based model. Equity assessment is conducted using regression analysis. Results on supply equity show that station-based and hybrid models are more equitable than the dockless model, as they allocate more devices to economically disadvantaged areas. Regarding utilization equity, regression models yield mixed results: depending on the disadvantaged indicators used to identify disadvantaged communities, both the station-based and hybrid/dockless models can exhibit characteristics of equity or inequity. Overall, our findings suggest that the hybrid model shows the most promising potential for improving both the equality and equity of the spatial distribution of shared micromobility services.</p>

              <p>

              </p>
              <h5>Abstract</h5>
              <p>Identifying spatial communities from human mobility data is vital for enhancing the understanding of spatial interaction patterns and urban structures. However, spatially embedded graphs derived from movements are often sparse and noisy, posing challenges for spatial community detection. While various methods have been proposed, most rely on statistical characteristics of graphs and struggle with sparse, noisy mobility data. Recently, graph embedding techniques have shown promise in learning low-dimensional representations for community detection. Yet, existing techniques often fail to preserve modular structures and rarely incorporate spatial constraints for spatially embedded graphs. To address these challenges, we developed an unsupervised spatial graph Transformer framework for spatial community detection. To preserve the modular structure in graphs, we modified the self-attention mechanism to capture both global and local information of nodes. To incorporate spatial constraints into the model, we develop a spatial encoding scheme that explicitly encodes multi-order adjacency relationships between spatial units. To train the proposed model in an unsupervised manner, we generate multiple subgraphs according to a data masking strategy. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms five representative methods in detecting spatial communities from movements with noise. When applied to taxi GPS trajectory data in Beijing, the spatial communities identified by the proposed method exhibit greater geographical continuity and stronger internal interactions. These communities not only enhance the understanding of travel patterns revealed by taxis but also provide valuable insights into the polycentric urban structure.</p>

              <p>
                Weifeng Zhou and Li Zhang,

              </p>
              <h5>Abstract</h5>
              <p>In modern fisheries management, trajectory data of fishing vessels are utilized to monitor and analyze vessel activities. However, such data are frequently impacted by environmental factors, equipment malfunctions, signal loss, and human errors, leading to a significant number of outliers. These outliers not only diminish the credibility of the data but also adversely affect subsequent data mining and decision-making processes. This study presents a data cleaning method for identifying outlier points in the trajectory of a fishing vessel based on the Geohash geocoding algorithm. The method entails the following steps: obtaining and pre-processing the trajectory data of a fishing vessel; generating the corresponding Geohash codes for each ship position based on its latitude and longitude; calculating the reachable distance according to the time interval between the current point and the following points as well as their speeds; querying the neighborhood of the current point based on the reachable distance, and obtaining all the Geohash codes of the reachable areas of the fishing vessels within the time interval as the reachable range grid set of the current position; comparing the reachable range grid sets of the current position with those of its preceding and succeeding points in the fishing vessel trajectory respectively. If there is no intersection with either of them, the current ship position is identified as an outlier point and removed. The method proposed in this study can effectively identify outliers in the trajectory data, achieving efficient and effective trajectory data cleaning, and enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the data.</p>

              <h3>A4. Immersive virtual reality and spatial navigation: The impacts of ADHD</h3>
              <p>
                Susannah Cox, University of Wisconsin--Madison, Department of Geography, UWCL - NeuroCarto Research Group
              </p>
              <h5>Abstract</h5>
              <p>Spatial navigation is a complex task that is dependent on several cognitive processes that can be hard to measure and replicate in traditional in-lab experiments. In comparison, immersive virtual reality proves to be a means to simulate real world contexts with enhanced ecological validity and spatial embodiment. As a result, immersive virtual reality continues to prove to be a useful tool to study spatial navigation. This research seeks to understand the impacts of executive dysfunction, present in ADHD adults, on navigational abilities and spatial learning. This study consists of two experimental tasks. The first is a wayfinding task, where participants are asked to traverse an urban virtual geographic environment and locate waypoints in a specified order according to a provided map. This task consists of ten levels that progressively get more difficult. The second task drops participants at a semi-random point in the environment they just traversed and asks them to orient themselves to the starting location; this heading orientation task tests participants’ spatial learning. Unlike traditional assessments, xR allows researchers to observe navigation behaviors dynamically, capturing how individuals with ADHD manage challenges like spatial working memory, attention, and cognitive load capacity during complex spatial tasks. This is particularly important for understanding how executive dysfunction affects real-world functioning and for tailoring environments or interventions to better support individuals with neurodivergent cognitive profiles. We hypothesize that as the wayfinding task increases in difficulty, we will see a divergence in participant performance with ADHD adults performing worse on all measures. This research will contribute to countering spatial deskilling and the development of neuro-adaptive navigational aids that support safety, efficiency, and spatial learning. </p>

              </p>
              <h5>Abstract</h5>
              <p>The study of segregation in activity spaces is undergoing a renaissance, driven by the increasing availability of geospatial data from mobile phones and social media. These new data sources have facilitated high-resolution spatial analysis of individual mobility patterns, offering insights into the diversity of visitors in different urban spaces. A key motivation behind this research is to foster social cohesion by designing inclusive spaces that encourage intergroup contact. However, amidst the enthusiasm for analyzing large datasets, an important nuance may have been overlooked—perception of diversity often plays a more significant role than objective measurements in shaping urban experiences. Yet, we know very little about the relationship between perceived and measured diversity in activity spaces.</p>

              <p>
                Dr. Pankajeshwara Sharma, Associate Professor, University of Fiji
              </p>
              <h5>Abstract</h5>
              <p>As the use of location-based services and geospatial analysis continues to grow, ensuring the privacy of individuals in shared spatial data has become more important than ever. Geomasking, a technique used to obscure precise geographic points, is commonly employed to protect privacy. However, traditional methods often rely on random processes or manual adjustments, which can be time-consuming and imprecise, requiring multiple iterations to reach the desired privacy level, which could be a barrier to masking many datasets simultaneously. Mechanisms that simplify geoprivacy application would significantly advance research and mark a key step forward in its practical adoption. In this talk, we discuss on a more efficient and intelligent solution, PrediMask, through the use of machine learning. Our approach trains models on a variety of geospatial datasets to predict the exact amount of displacement needed to achieve a specific privacy rating. By analyzing key factors such as point density, the average distance between neighboring points, and the spread of data, our model aims to accurately forecast the necessary masking distance to maintain privacy, based on Spruill’s geoprivacy measure. This predictive geomasking method aims to not only save time but ensures that privacy standards are consistently met, without compromising the quality of the data. Our research aims to demonstrate how machine learning can transform privacy protection in geospatial data by offering automated and reliable solutions for protecting sensitive information.</p>

              <h3>A7. Recharging the 15-Minute City: How e-micromobility is expanding access</h3>
              <p>
                Priyanka Verma, Dan Qiang, Grant McKenzie (Platial Analysis Lab, McGill University, Montreal, Canada)
              </p>
              <h5>Abstract</h5>
              <p>The concept of the 15-Minute City has emerged as an idealized framework for sustainable, human-scale urban planning.  It promotes access to essential services, such as schools, parks, grocery stores, and hospitals, within 15 minutes of active travel (walk or bicycle) from a resident's home. Much of the current scholarly and policy focus has centred on walkability, with limited attention to how new mobility modes such as e-micromobility services (e-scooters and e-bikes) are reshaping this accessibility discussion. In this work, we address an important gap in existing literature by evaluating the role of shared e-micromobility in extending amenity access across five international cities: Berlin, Germany; London, UK; Paris, France; Wellington, New Zealand; and Washington DC, USA.

                Analyzing 24 million real-world e-micromobility trips collected between 2020 and 2024 and their relationship to OpenStreetMap points of interest (POI), we identify spatiotemporal patterns of access. The methodology involves calculating trip durations for walking and e-micromobility between trip origins/destinations and five categories of amenities (hospitals, parks, schools, grocery stores, entertainment venues). Using an Inverse Distance Weighting interpolation approach, we generate fine-resolution duration surfaces for each transport mode, city, and POI type. The accessibility surfaces are then reclassified into three temporal thresholds, under 15 minutes, 15-30 minutes, and over 30 minutes, with the goal of evaluating and comparing mode-specific accessibility.
                
                Our results reveal that e-micromobility significantly enhances 15-minute accessibility, particularly in lower-density, car-centric cities. For instance, in Wellington, e-micromobility triples the percentage of the city that is reachable within 15 minutes for school access. Washington DC sees similar improvements across all POI types, with accessibility increases ranging from 10-20% compared to walking. In contrast, European cities such as Berlin and London, which already feature high baseline walkability, report modest gains, especially for shorter trips.
                
                Importantly, we find that accessibility enhancements are not uniform across amenity types. Schools and parks benefit most from e-micromobility, while access to hospitals and entertainment venues shows greater variability depending on spatial distribution. Furthermore, improvements are most noticeable in peripheral and under-served areas, demonstrating e-micromobility's potential to address spatial inequities and fill access gaps in the urban periphery.</p>

              <h3>A8. Under Pressure: The Impact of Psychological Stress on Usability in Cartographic Interaction</h3>
              <p>
                Brynn Patrello. University of Wisconsin-Madison
              </p>
              <h5>Abstract</h5>
              <p>From escaping a natural disaster to finding a dentist's office on time, people often use maps while under stress. Yet, little research has explored how stress affects users during cartographic interaction. This study addresses that gap by asking: What is the role of psychological stress in cartographic interaction?

                To investigate, participants first undergo a modified Trier Social Stress Test, a proven method in psychology to induce stress through social-evaluative and cognitive challenges. Then, they complete mapping tasks using maps of varying visual complexity. Their performance is observed to assess how stress influences map-based decision-making.
                
                The study mirrors real-life scenarios where users approach maps already stressed—not because of the map itself, but due to external pressures. This stress may still impact their decisions, behaviors, and interaction with the map. The research evaluates both quantitative and qualitative metrics. Quantitative measures include task completion rate, speed, and accuracy. Qualitative insights focus on user experience, perceived usability, and interaction pragmatics.
                
                Visual complexity is a key variable due to its known effects on user stress. By applying different complexity levels across stressed and non-stressed participant groups, the study isolates the role of both stress and design in user performance.
                
                Ultimately, this research emphasizes that users are not always neutral or consistent—psychological states matter. Understanding how stress affects map use can help cartographers design with empathy, creating tools that better support users in high-stress situations. It also encourages a shift in user studies toward considering the user's mental state as a key design variable, not just the interface itself.</p>

              <h3>A9. Protecting sensitive locations in urban movement data through behaviour-preserving map-matched trajectories</h3>
              <p>
                Maike Gatzlaff, University of Auckland
              </p>
              <h5>Abstract</h5>
              <p>Movement trajectory anonymisation remains an ongoing topic as privacy requirements become stricter, and the surplus of data generated daily makes anonymisation more complex. Currently, the utility of securely anonymised trajectory data remains low for most use cases as information such as traffic characteristics or drivers behaviour get lost due to generalisation. In our solution, we aim to preserve information on movement behaviour, such as speeding or dangerous driving, while hindering the profiling of individuals.

                We propose building on the promising approach of interchanging user information to preserve an individual’s privacy. Yet, most well-established concepts rely on pre-defined geometries to connect one user's trajectory to another. These so-called mix-zones are often masked - meaning no movement data is available at certain locations. To address this gap, we propose a map-matching-based framework that generates synthetic trajectories by mimicking the movement characteristics of nearby users and connecting segments via shortest-path algorithms. This approach allows for bigger gaps between sub-trajectories and enhances the potential for linking them.
                
                Our approach enables splitting and reconnecting trajectories based on spatial and temporal proximity to another user’s (sub-)trajectory, whether real or artificially generated. Furthermore, sub-trajectories that could disclose sensitive personal information, such as stops at semantically important locations, can be replaced with synthetic sub-trajectories. Using map-matching algorithms, we modify trajectory points related to these stops to simulate continuous travel. The resulting synthetic trajectories reflect realistic traffic patterns by drawing on the movement behaviour of nearby users or from movement behaviour immediately before/after the sensitive stop.
                
                By interchanging user information of sub-trajectories at random road segments, a maximum number of raw trajectory points mapped to the road network is maintained - a crucial factor for high utility. Sensitive locations are protected by synthetic trajectory points, and no regions are obscured by cloaking or mix-zone geometries.</p>

              <p>

              </p>
              <h5>Abstract</h5>
              <p>Spatial weights are often treated as instrumental tools in spatial analysis. Yet, the ideas and assumptions shaping such weights often go unquestioned and are not always fully explicated. This abstract shares early insights into an ongoing systematic study exploring how empirical researchers frame and define spatial weights. At the center of our research is one key question: What meanings do researchers ascribe to spatial linkages when they formalize them into spatial weights? We address this question utilizing a hermeneutic approach, which enables researchers to interpret underlying positions. 

                Drawing from a structured review of more than 16,000 articles indexed in Scopus and Web of Science, we use a filtering and clustering approach to identify a manageable group of 30 empirical studies for detailed qualitative analysis. The selection process begins by narrowing the dataset down to 638 abstracts, a number that ensures representativeness for the overall corpus. Since this number is too extensive for our intended qualitative analysis, two-step screening is then applied using an inclusion/exclusion protocol and expert agreement to settle on 30 studies. Our methodological innovation lies in combining structured corpus selection with qualitative hermeneutic inquiry, allowing for a deeper look into the ideas and assumptions that guide methodological decisions involving spatial weights.
                
                Our so far obtained early findings already show repeating patterns in how scholars operationalize spatial linkages through their chosen methods. This work opens space for broader conversations about what formal spatial concepts like spatial weights actually mean in practice. By uncovering and interpreting the assumptions embedded in methodological choices, we aim to promote more reflexive spatial modeling practices in addition to technical rigor. Our work contributes to growing efforts to include deeper interpretive practices within spatial analysis and foster the community's self-awareness and critical engagement.</p>

              <h5>Abstract</h5>
              <p>Accurate large-scale geolocalization and 3D scene reconstruction are fundamental problems in geographic information science. Neural implicit representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), have recently enabled photorealistic 3D modeling. However, visual localization using NeRF remains limited by poor scalability and high computational cost, especially in large-scale environments. We propose MatLoc-NeRF, a novel matching-based localization framework that efficiently estimates camera poses using selected NeRF features. At its core, MatLoc-NeRF introduces a learnable feature selection module that identifies the most informative NeRF features for matching with query images. This avoids reliance on dense scene descriptors or exhaustive comparisons, substantially improving localization accuracy and efficiency. To support large-scale deployment, MatLoc-NeRF incorporates a pose-aware scene partitioning strategy. This method activates only the relevant NeRF sub-block based on the predicted query pose, enabling localized feature extraction and reducing memory and computation overhead. Additionally, we integrate a scene segmentation module and a lightweight place recognition network to deliver fast and robust coarse pose estimates, effectively narrowing down candidate regions and accelerating the overall localization process. We evaluate MatLoc-NeRF on two public large-scale benchmarks and compare it against state-of-the-art NeRF-based localization methods, including iNeRF and Curriculum iNeRF. Experimental results show that MatLoc-NeRF achieves superior accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating its robustness across diverse scenes and lighting conditions. Unlike prior methods, it scales gracefully to complex environments without compromising localization quality.</p>

              <h5>Abstract</h5>
              <p>
                This research presents an applied, multidisciplinary collaboration between urban design and human-computer interaction, focusing on the integration of civic knowledge into digital planning tools. It builds on the framework of the Social Digital Twin and incorporates Participatory GIS (PGIS) methods to address the spatial invisibility of unrecognized Bedouin villages in Israel's Negev region.
                
                Unrecognized villages are home to tens of thousands of residents, yet remain absent from official government maps and databases. Lacking basic services, infrastructure, and formal planning recognition, these communities operate largely outside the formal spatial system. This research asks how Digital Twin technology — typically used for buildings and infrastructure — can be redefined as a social tool, shaped by local knowledge and lived experience.
                
                The case study focuses on the village of 'Al Naam'. In the first phase, we designed and implemented a digital survey using ESRI Survey123, collecting spatial data from residents. Participants were asked to describe locations, mark routes, and give directions using local landmarks and terminology. In the second phase, we began developing a PGIS tool based on this data, enabling residents to map their environment collaboratively.
                
                Our findings reveal that residents possess rich spatial knowledge based on culturally embedded reference points such as “the white mountain,” “the green caravan,” and local mosques. These verbal maps fill the gaps left by the absence of formal geospatial data. By transforming these narratives into spatial layers, we demonstrate how community-driven data collection can inform planning, enhance visibility, and support more inclusive governance. The project offers a model for using digital twins not only as technical systems but as tools for civic empowerment in marginalized areas.

              <h5>Abstract</h5>
              <p>Gazetteers link place names to their geographic footprints and associated contextual knowledge. While traditionally used in cartography and geography, modern gazetteers have evolved into extensive sources of geographic intelligence. However, within Aotearoa New Zealand's rich cultural and historical landscape, existing gazetteers often lack the capacity to integrate conventional geographic datasets with indigenous, narrative-rich place name resources. We propose a culturally enriched gazetteer model for Aotearoa New Zealand, extending the Alexandria Digital Library (ADL) Gazetteer Content Standard (GCS) to integrate geospatial and cultural dimensions. The proposed model consolidates data from authoritative datasets such as the Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) gazetteer and volunteered geographic information (VGI) platforms like GeoNames and OpenStreetMap. A key innovation is the inclusion of Māori cultural knowledge through whakapapa, the lineage, stories, and histories associated with place names, enabled by extending the etymology component of the ADL model. Structured as a relational database, the gazetteer supports multiple names, feature types, and geometries per place, while maintaining temporal information and source provenance. It accommodates bilingual names in Māori and English, as well as alternative spellings, abbreviations, and variants, reflecting the linguistic diversity of New Zealand's toponymy. Another distinctive feature of this gazetteer is the integration of georeferenced locality descriptions derived from biodiversity collection records. These often refer to unnamed or informally described places, and their inclusion facilitates georeferencing tasks by centralising both named and descriptive spatial data. The database is populated via an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline in PostgreSQL, using PostGIS for spatial data maintenance. We also plan to incorporate self-learning capabilities to infer coordinates for previously unrecorded place names. Upon completion, this gazetteer aims to serve as a repository of New Zealand's geographic features and cultural heritage, encompassing more locations than existing gazetteers for the region, and supporting GIS, ecology, digital humanities, and indigenous knowledge systems. </p>

              <h5>Abstract</h5>
              <p>Ontology engineering—the systematic design of machine-readable vocabularies or ontologies—has a long history in GI science. The promise of such “geo-ontologies” is to provide solutions to some of the most long-standing challenges in the field, such as semantic interoperability; tracking provenance and metadata; and capturing enormous richness of geospatial data and phenomena with simple and consistent representations. Recent rapid advances in large language models (LLMs) have provided renewed impetus for geo-ontology engineering, because knowledge-based representation and reasoning offers structural and logical characteristics that complement the strengths of LLMs for pattern-matching unstructured data.  

                However, geo-ontology engineering is fraught with pitfalls and snares. Errors are frequent, especially for less-experienced ontology engineers. This paper argues that three key errors are most commonly encountered, including in papers in the domain of geographic information science. The paper explores in more detail these three types errors, illustrated through the example of engineering a geo-ontology for update and revision of foundation spatial data (SMURF, the spatial management, update, and revision framework) within a recent project in partnership with state-based mapping agency (the “Dynamic Vicmap” project).  
                
                In brief, the three key errors relate to ontology reuse, clarity, and consistency. Reuse is a core principle of ontology engineering, which enables ontologies to be more modular and standardized, and data to be more easily linked together. Clarity relates to avoiding errors in definition, such as misclassifying instances as classes. Consistency relates to avoiding internal contradictions, and most concerns the domain-specific judgements embodied in a geo-ontology, such as deciding whether an entity is best represented as an instance or attribute. Examples of each type of error are illustrated with reference to the SMURF geo-ontology, engineered to represent and link multiple statewide hydrology, property, and flood event data sets reusing established ontology standards, including GeoSPARQL, PROV-O and DCAT.  </p>

              <h5>Abstract</h5>
              <p>
                Monitoring parcel-level urban development is necessary to characterise how cities are changing to accommodate growing populations. Multi-temporal datasets of parcel-level development type are required to understand how development affects socio-economic, environmental and climatic outcomes and to guide planning policy and analyses that promote sustainable and liveable cities. However, generating consistent classifications of parcel-level development across time and jurisdictions remains challenging. To address this gap, a multi-modal deep learning model is presented and validated that converts urban land cover and built form data into classifications of a parcel’s development type. The classes under consideration are single unit, multi-unit, low-rise apartments, cluster dwellings, high-rise apartments, other urban, urban vegetation, rural and bare earth. This system is based on the SWIN-V2 Transformer architecture but is adapted to also consider surface cover, built form and spatial metrics encoded as attribute tables associated with each parcel. This model is trained and tested using Nearmap AI data covering five Australian cities and multiple time-points (Perth, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide). A ground truth dataset of over 70,000 parcels were labelled across Perth and a Perth-specific model was trained and evaluated. The Perth model was adapted to other Australian cities using a transfer learning workflow. A fine-tuning training dataset was generated by detecting parcels in other cities that were out-of-distribution from the Perth training dataset. The Perth model was fine-tuned using LoRA with a sample of out-of-distribution samples from other cities and was evaluated on representative city-specific test datasets. This model was applied to every property parcel in each of the five cities in 2019 and 2023 to generate complete city-wide maps of parcel-level development type. These maps are used to characterise the nature, extent and spatial patterns of different types of development occurring in Australian cities.

              <h5>Abstract</h5>
              <p>
                The growing interdependence between urban economic development and heatwave risks demands new analytical frameworks, particularly for coastal cities facing dual pressures of climate change and rapid urbanization. We propose a novel GIScience framework integrating Heat Index (HI) calibrated with local humidity patterns, machine learning, and spatial-statistical modeling to quantify bidirectional relationships between economic trajectories and population exposure to heatwaves across global coastal cities by 2100. Our approach uniquely combines CMIP6 climate projections, high-resolution urban expansion projections, and SSPs socioeconomic scenarios through a three-stage analytical framework: (1) dynamic calculation of humidity-adjusted heatwave exposure using spatially varying HI thresholds, (2) Mann-Kendall trend analysis of long-term heatwave intensification, along with correlation and ANOVA analyses to preliminarily explore economic-heatwave exposure relationships, (3) machine learning-driven identification of non-linear economic-exposure linkages via random forest regression with SHAP interpretability, and generalized nonlinear modeling to capture city-specific response curves between GDP growth and exposure intensification.
    Results demonstrate significant spatial heterogeneity in economic-heatwave exposure interactions, and coastal cities under current low- and high-income levels will face relatively more severe and rapidly intensifying heatwave exposure. Three distinct risk categories emerge through cluster analysis: Development Imbalance Risk, Economic Lag Risk, and Potential Risk Alert, leading to targeted strategies for sustainable urban development in the face of heatwave risks.
    This research advances GIScience through three principal contributions: (1) an open-source HI processing toolkit enabling humidity-aware exposure mapping in coastal microclimates, (2) demonstration of machine learning's capability to decode complex economic-climate interactions beyond traditional linear assumptions, and (3) a transferable risk classification framework and modeling workflow bridging climate projections with economic decision-making, directly supporting SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities) and 13 (Climate Action). The findings underscore the necessity of context-specific strategies for harmonizing economic development with heat resilience in coastal urban systems, offering significant advancements for sustainable urban planning and climate action.

              <h5>Abstract</h5>
              <p>
                Semantic enrichment is the process of augmenting data with additional contextual information that helps disambiguate its meaning. In practice, the semantic data enrichment process typically involves uplifting traditional data sources, such as tabular or object-relational, with connections to standard published ontologies.  Conventional semantic data enrichment approaches are often based on ad hoc scripting and coding pipelines. Consequently, these bespoke approaches result in substantial development and maintenance costs, time, and manual effort. They may also undermine the quality and scalability of the enrichment applications, give rise to significant duplication, and negatively impact their long-term usability. 

                To address these challenges, our approach explores the use of declarative mapping languages to enrich spatial data. The approach is founded on separating the semantic mapping logic from the mechanism of performing the mapping, two aspects that are conflated by scripting and coding pipelines. Separating these aspects is expected to lead to the development of more transparent and reusable semantic data enrichment techniques. However, to date, most such explorations have focused solely on non-spatial data.  
                
                We employed Australian place name data as a case study to evaluate the effectiveness of semantic spatial data enrichment using declarative mapping. RDF Mapping Language (RML) was used to semantically enrich place names across each state in Australia, resulting in a national placename knowledge graph. Place names were enriched with metadata and contextual information using standard ontologies, including Place Names Ontology, Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT), Data Quality Vocabulary (DQV), and GeoSPARQL Ontology.
                
                The proposed transparent and reusable approach enhances the quality of insights derived from the knowledge graph while minimizing the overall cost of the transformation process. It results in a more efficient and effective semantic enrichment process. The place name knowledge graph can quickly adapt to new modifications with minimal resources and ensure long-term usability and maintainability of the application.

              <p>
                Participatory mapping has gained visibility within geographic information sciences in recent decades. Alongside community engagement, it can complement traditional data production to better capture local knowledge. Geographic data production has advanced in line with the underpinning technologies in the same period. However, those participatory exercises do not always positively impact the intended populations. 
This paper compiles and analyses a series of participatory mapping cases presented in the “mapping with communities” workshops organised at the GIScience 2023 and AGILE 2024 conferences. The authors use five categories to understand the case studies contributions: i) What and Why, or the purpose and elements mapped; ii) Who, or the stakeholders involved in the mapping activities; iii) Where, or the location of the mapping activities; iv) How, or the methods applied and v) Impact, or the personal and territorial changes that the mapping initiated. To assess the last category, the team screened different general impact assessment frameworks. An adapted framework helps assess the impact of all the case studies in terms of Higher-level, Instrumental, Conceptual, and Low-Level. Conversely, the research question: How can participatory mapping drive impactful changes or benefits for society? drives the discussion.
By compiling, discussing and publishing this impact assessment, the authors acknowledge contributions from workshop participants to enable advocacy of vulnerable communities' livelihoods. The identified research focus of the studies in countries of the global south indicates the particular data requirements of those regions and the researchers' interests in working with historically marginalised communities. Moreover, the role of external parties and researchers initiating most of the mapping procedures highlights that these are still complex processes that require stronger engagement, especially from government agencies. Among other outcomes, the analysis claims that in order to strengthen the credibility of participatory methods, better impact assessment frameworks are needed while this first attempt served to identify key impact dimensions. This assessment highlights the importance of embedding impact throughout the entire process. While high-level impact (i.e., societal change) is desirable, it often requires additional time to materialise.

              <p>
                Many urban planning master plans by local governments in Japan consider “interactions among diverse individuals” as a key factor in promoting urban vibrancy. Such interactions are more likely to occur when people from diverse backgrounds stay within the same urban spaces. However, while much research had addressed these interactions themselves, the quantitative evaluation of the diversity of the staying population in urban spaces has received limited attention. To support effective urban measures such as organizing events in open spaces, the diversity evaluation therein in advance is important. This study proposes a method for such diversity evaluation at high spatial resolution. Although the diversity in individual's values and knowledge is difficult to observe directly, this study assumes that such diversity can be inferred from characteristics of their residential areas, for which data is often available. Specifically, we prepare 18 variables for each 1-kilometer grid such as age composition, family composition, employment status, and education level from national census data. These are aggregated into one-dimensional values via principal component analysis. We also utilize 500-meter grid-based population data derived from mobile phone location records, which are linked to users’ places of residence in 1-kilometer grid. Consequently, for each 500-meter grid, we can determine the composition of the staying population based on residential characteristics. The diversity of the staying population is then calculated using differential entropy, a metric from information theory. The results for two prefectures in Japan showed that high levels of diversity were found not only in central urban areas, large hospitals, and suburban shopping malls, but also in certain grids without any notable facilities. In these cases, the areas attracted people from residential areas with diverse characteristics. Furthermore, we identified several interesting cases where the level of diversity differed significantly among grids with similar facilities.

              <h5>Abstract</h5>
              <p>
                Wetlands play an important role in the ecosystem. Wetland loss has been estimated at over 90% in Aotearoa New Zealand. Restoring these important environments can bring significant benefits such as flood protection, runoff mitigation, and support for wildlife. Identifying restoration sites with high public visibility may enhance awareness and appreciation of these landscapes.
                This paper explores the use of viewshed analysis to calculate visibility across the Ruamahanga basin in the Wairarapa to better identify areas where former wetlands can be restored. To enhance this method, we combine visibility analysis with mobile phone tracking data to determine the weighting associated with different locations, reflecting human movement patterns. For studies where such data is unavailable, we developed a simulation model using spatial data from the Ruamahanga and two other similar-sized catchments to predict areas of high human movement and their visibility weighting. This scalable approach can guide decision-making for wetland restoration efforts, ensuring ecological gains are paired with improved public awareness. 
                Such a method will be of interest to planners, conservationists, and local councils seeking to maximize the social and ecological benefits of wetland restoration projects. By identifying locations where restored wetlands are both ecologically viable and highly visible, this approach could help increase public engagement and support for conservation initiatives.

              <h3>A21. Predicting Forest Fire Refugia Using Machine Learning: The Role of Topography and Microclimatic Variables</h3>
              <p>

              <p>
                Forest fire refugia are areas within fire-prone landscapes that remain fire-free or experience lower fire frequency and severity. These refugia are crucial for biodiversity, supporting species, maintaining mature vegetation, and aiding post-fire recovery. They enhance forest resilience by preserving genetic diversity and facilitating regeneration. Understanding how topography influences fire behaviour is key to identifying and conserving refugia, informing forest management to protect them from logging and disturbances. Machine learning models using wind patterns and altitude can effectively predict refugia in localized areas, aiding conservation efforts and promoting ecosystem resilience in fire-prone regions.
                Forest fire refugia can be accurately predicted using aspect, surface wind direction and speed (derived from computational fluid dynamics), topographic roughness, and temperature in machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost; 2 ensembles models) and K-Nearest Neighbour (all run with and without ADASYN over-sampling). Six iterations were run per algorithm to assess the impact of leaving variables out. Among these variables, aspect is the most influential across both feature importance (Random Forest) and feature gain (XGBoost), as it aligns fire refugia with the leeward slopes of prevailing fire winds. Surface wind speed and direction, and global irradiation are also key predictors, with significant drops in model accuracy when these features are excluded.
                Temperature and topographic roughness show context-dependent importance. Temperature was significant in XGBoost but diminished after ADASYN oversampling, while topographic roughness increased in importance when elevation was excluded. Elevation did not significantly enhance model performance, and its exclusion had minimal impact on predictive accuracy.
                Ensemble models consistently produced the most accurate results, although accuracy metrics across all experiments where high and averaged 0.96 (±0.2), indicating robust predictive performance.
                These findings highlight the importance of topographic and microclimatic variables in fire refugia prediction, with machine learning providing reliable forecasting frameworks.

              <p>

              <p>
                Observing and analyzing human movement on a large spatial scale is crucial for managing crowding, guiding emergency responses, and supporting commercial and tourism planning. In dense urban areas, where population distribution fluctuates rapidly due to public transportation, traditional static datasets provide limited insights. This necessitates methods for dynamically mapping population distributions in real time. However, existing datasets on static and mobile populations vary in temporal resolution, spatial coverage, and sampling fraction, imposing constraints on research and analysis.
                This study proposes a method for constructing a spatiotemporal data structure of moving individuals by integrating multiple population datasets while leveraging their strengths. The primary dataset, derived from mobile phone base station coverage, estimates total population distribution, including transient and static individuals. A secondary GPS-based dataset, transmitted every five minutes, provides detailed movement patterns despite a lower sampling rate and is used to estimate inter-grid-cell movement fractions. A maximum likelihood estimator quantifies grid-cell entries and exits, with validation against precisely measured flow data confirming the approach’s accuracy.
                To further assess the method's applicability, we analyze multiple urban regions, quantifying transient population numbers and their movement patterns over time. This approach revealed notable differences in movement dynamics between weekdays and weekends, as well as distinct travel patterns in commercial and office districts that appeared similar in static datasets. The proposed methodology allows for the identification of transient population numbers and movement directions at any given time across large spatial scales. By constructing comprehensive spatiotemporal datasets for both static and transient urban populations, this study introduces new analytical perspectives for understanding urban dynamics.
                Future research will focus on developing models to evaluate the impact of large-scale public events and natural disasters on population movement. These models will offer valuable insights for crowd management, risk mitigation, emergency response planning, and evacuation strategies, ultimately enhancing urban resilience.

              <h5>Abstract</h5>
              <p>
                Disasters often cause road network degradation resulting in reduced traffic capacity, which directly impacts emergency response. In GIScience, it is common to model road networks as directed graphs, which provide a formal framework for analyzing traffic flow. These analyses tend to focus on computing graph-based metrics as a series of edges are removed from static graphs (Knoop et al., 2012, Loretti et al., 2022). For static graphs, there are alternative algorithms that can determine the maximum flow between intersections across the graph in polynomial time. For infrastructure networks which contain a very large number of nodes and edges, these algorithms become computationally expensive. Further, in dynamic models, where edges are constantly added and removed, recomputing the maximum flow value becomes highly inefficient. We propose an algorithm to efficiently analyze and visualize road network capacity under changing conditions using techniques from Topological Data Analysis. The algorithm can also be used for determining the maximum flow value between two geographic regions (i.e. from one collection of nodes to another). It starts by computing a maximum flow on the original graph. If the new edge goes from node u to node v, the new maximum flow value is determined by solving two smaller independent maximum flow problems: from the source to u and from v to the sink. The increase in maximum flow value is equal to the smaller value of these two subproblems. These computations are performed in parallel with information recycled across iterations to reduce redundancy. This algorithm results in a maximum flow on the graph, ensuring immediate iterability and analysis as edges are added or removed. Future work will improve the algorithm for dynamic infrastructure models with a long-term goal of providing a comprehensive tool for understanding the stability of road networks in geographic regions susceptible to degradation.

              <h3>A24. Foundation Spectral Model-Based Detection of Parasitic Plants in Urban Environments: A Case Study of Struthanthus interruptus</h3>
              <p>
                Paola Andrea Mejia-Zuluaga, Hugo Carlos Martinez, Juan Carlos Valdiviezo-N, León Dozal (Research Center in Geospatial Information Science (CentroGeo))

              <h5>Abstract</h5>
              <p>
                Struthanthus interruptus, a parasitic plant, poses a rising threat to Mexico City's urban areas. This hemiparasite infests a wide variety of native tree species, lowering their health, hastening mortality, and eventually diminishing the ecosystem services they provide. Traditional detection is based on costly fieldwork and expert visual recognition, which limits the frequency and scope of monitoring activities. Although UAV-based multispectral photography has made data collection more effective, finding mistletoe species, particularly those that visibly blend in with their hosts, remains a substantial issue due to their spectral and morphological similarities.

In this study, we explore how foundation models trained on spectral data can detect S. interruptus in drone-acquired multispectral imagery. We specifically assess the performance of a spectral transformer architecture (SpectralGPT) that has been pre-trained on several spectral datasets in order to encode image patches and detect parasitic signals. Unlike traditional deep learning algorithms that require huge labeled datasets, foundation models can generalize from small amounts of annotated data using spectral priors and transfer learning.

We trained and evaluated our technique on photos from urban parks with proven infestations, utilizing expert-curated segmentation masks for validation. To achieve uniform spectral representation across samples, the picture data was preprocessed using a comprehensive pipeline that included radiometric correction, geometric alignment, and band coregistration.

Preliminary findings show that spectral embeddings derived from foundation models capture significant differences between infested and non-infested canopy patches, even under changing phenological conditions. Our ongoing study attempts to improve the classification method by including few-shot learning and interpretability tools to understand the model's decision criteria.

This study advances the field of remote sensing and ecological monitoring by proving the viability of using foundation models for species-level plant detection in urban environments. It brings up new possibilities for low-cost, high-precision monitoring of parasite infestations in tree canopies.

This work contributes to the growing body of research using foundation models to solve geographic ecological challenges, with a focus on species detection under high spectral similarity.

              <h3>A25. Jointly spatial-temporal representation learning for individual trajectories</h3>
              <p>

              <h5>Abstract</h5>
              <p>
                Individual trajectories, capturing signiﬁcant human-environment interactions across space and time, serve as vital inputs for geospatial foundation models (GeoFMs). However, existing attempts at learning trajectory representations often encoded trajectory spatial temporal relationships implicitly, which poses challenges in learning and representing spatiotemporal patterns accurately. Therefore, this paper proposes a joint spatial- temporal graph representation learning method (ST-GraphRL) to formalize structurally-explicit while learnable spatial-temporal dependencies into trajectory representations. The proposed ST-GraphRL consists of three compositions: (i) a weighted directed spatial-temporal graph to explicitly construct mobility interactions over space and time dimensions; (ii) a two-stage joint encoder (i.e., decoupling and fusion), to learn entangled spatial- temporal dependencies by independently decomposing and jointly aggregating features in space and time; (iii) a decoder guides ST-GraphRL to learn mobility regularities and randomness by simulating the spatial-temporal joint distributions of trajectories. Tested on three real-world human mobility datasets, the proposed ST- GraphRL outperformed all the baseline models in predicting movements' spatial-temporal distributions and preserving trajectory similarity with high spatial-temporal correlations. Furthermore, analyzing spatial-temporal features in latent space, it afﬁrms that the ST-GraphRL can effectively capture underlying mobility patterns. The results may also provide insights into representation learnings of other geospatial data to achieve general- purpose data representations, promoting the progress of GeoFMs.
